TRIMD
Transcriptome Resolution by Integration of Multi-platform Data
=================================================================

Scripts included:
TRIMD_start_validator.pl
TRIMD_junction_validator.pl
TRIMD_end_validator.pl
TRIMD_transcript_validator.pl

=================================================================

Notes for all scripts:

Defaults are set using the Epstein-Barr virus Akata strain as a model.

Annotation file should contain only features for polyadenylated transcripts and must be sorted by chrStart, then chrEnd.

Fasta files of Iso-Seq data must have names formatted as putative_isoform_id/number_of_SMRT_reads/length, as from the Iso-Seq pipeline.

Circular genomes present problems for most aligners: they are generally depicted in a linear form in aligner reference files. Reads that span the locus where the genome is linearized do not map properly. To overcome this limitation you may run the alignments and TRIMD twice: once to the standard genome and once to a version of the genome that is linearized at its opposite point (position N/2, where N is the length of the genome). This will allow detection of transcripts that span the linearization site.

TRIMD_start_validator.pl
---------------------

USAGE: perl /PATH/TRIMD_start_validator.pl </PATH/SMRT_sam_file> </PATH/CAGE_file> </PATH/Annotation_bed_file>

Accepts a SAM file of Iso-Seq fl data, a SAM file of CAGE data, and a bed file of annotated polyadenylated transcripts. Counts the number of non-clipped SMRT reads with 5' starts at each genomic position and estimates consensus locations of clusters of 5' starts. Uses Paraclu to identify clusters of 5' starts in the CAGE data. Output includes BEDGRAPH files of all 5' starts, BED files of the weighted centers of start clusters and a BED file of Iso-Seq 5' starts supported by either the annotation or the CAGE data.
Paraclu was written by Martin C Frith 2006, Genome Exploration Research Group, RIKEN GSC and Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland and distributed under the GNU General Public License.


INPUT
------
1. SAM file of Iso-Seq fl isoforms: this script was developed using data aligned with GMAP (-f samse option). Other aligners may also be appropriate.

2. SAM file of CAGE reads: this script was developed using data aligned with STAR. Other aligners may also be appropriate.

3. BED file of annotated polyadenylated transcripts: the annotation file MUST be sorted by chrStart, then chrEnd. If your annotation file contains non-polyadenylated transcripts or other features (e.g. repeat regions, promoters) these should be removed to avoid false positives.


PARAMETERS
----------
1. (Viral) chromosome name: the name of the chromosome under investigation. This must match between both SAM files (field 3) and the BED annotation file (field 1). Does not have to be viral, but for organisms with multiple chromosomes only one chromosome can be examined at a time.
No default: must be entered at prompt

2. Window for collapsing Iso-Seq 5' starts: Iso-Seq 5' starts within this number of bases of each other will be considered to represent the same transcription start site. The consensus transcription start site is determined by calculating an average of the coordinates in the cluster, weighted by read depth at each coordinate.
Default: 8

3. Minimum tags per CAGE cluster: the minimum number of CAGE tags in a cluster to be considered a potential transcription start site.
Default: 15

4. Minimum relative density for CAGE clusters: a measure of change in tag density between the cluster and its surroundings. Higher number = bigger change. For more information, see the Paraclu paper referenced
Default: 2

5. Minimum CAGE cluster length: the minimum cluster length, in base pairs, to be considered a potential transcription start site.
Default: 1

6. Maximum CAGE cluster length: the maximum cluster length, in base pairs, to be considered a potential transcription start site.
Default: 20

7. Maximum allowable distance between Iso-Seq and CAGE 5' starts: Maximum distance of a CAGE consensus start site from an Iso-Seq consensus start site to consider the start site validated.
Default: 3

8. Minimum number of SMRT reads to report a 5' start: the minimum number of Iso-Seq 5' starts in a cluster to be considered a potential transcription start site
Default: 1

9. Maximum distance in bp from an annotated start site to be called as "annotated"
Default: 10


OUTPUT
------
1. A BED file of validated 5' starts: this file is in bedDetail format, using the first 6 standard bed fields and an additional field that is necessary for the TRIMD_transcript_validator.pl script. The coordinates are those of the Iso-Seq consensus 5' start. The name field is in the format [nov|ann]_[+|-]_123.IsoSeq_456.CAGE and indicates whether the start site is novel or annotated, strand, the number of SMRT reads supporting it and the number of CAGE tags supporting it. The score is the number of SMRT reads and CAGE tags added together. The additional field indicates the range of the SMRT start cluster and number of supporting SMRT reads. Note that the validated starts file includes Iso-Seq starts that are supported by CAGE and/or annotation data. You may wish to filter the results to contain only starts that are supported by CAGE.

2. A text file with the number of total, novel and annotated 5' start sites validated, and a record of the input files.

3. BED file of Iso-Seq consensus 5' starts

4. BEDGRAPH file of all nonclipped Iso-Seq 5' starts

5. BED file of CAGE consensus 5' starts

6. BEDGRAPH file of all nonclipped CAGE 5' starts

The coordinates are those of the Illumina consensus 3' end. The name field is in the format [nov|ann]_[+|-]_123.IsoSeq_456.CAGE and indicates whether the end is novel or annotated, strand, the number of SMRT reads supporting it and the number of Illumina poly(A) reads supporting it. The score is the number of SMRT reads and Illumina poly(A) reads added together. The additional field indicates the range of the SMRT end cluster and number of supporting SMRT reads. Note that the validated starts file includes SMRT ends that are supported by Illumina and/or annotation data. You may wish to filter the results to contain only starts that are supported by Illumina.

TRIMD_transcript_validator.pl
--------------------------

USAGE: perl /PATH/TRIMD_transcript_validator.pl </PATH/SMRT_sam_file> </PATH/validated_starts_file> </PATH/validated_ends_file> </PATH/validated_introns_file> </PATH/Annotation_bed_file>

Takes a SAM file of Iso-Seq fl isoforms and compares them to a list of validated 5' ends, 3' ends and introns to create a list of validated isoform structures, which are compared to an annotation file.


INPUT
-----
1. SAM file of Iso-Seq fl isoforms

2. BedDetail file of validated starts: the output file from TRIMD_start_validator.pl that ends ".validated_starts.bed"

3. BedDetail file of validated ends: the output file from TRIMD_end_validator.pl that ends ".validated_ends.bed"

4. BedDetail file of validated splice junctions: the output file from TRIMD_junction_matcher.pl that ends ".validated_introns.bed"

5. BED file of annotated polyadenylated transcripts: the annotation file MUST be sorted by chrStart, then chrEnd. If your annotation file contains non-polyadenylated transcripts or other features (e.g. repeat regions, promoters) these should be removed to avoid false positives.

Note that the chromosome names must match exactly between all of the input files.


PARAMETERS
----------
1. Maximum distance from an annotated 5' start to be called annotated
Default: 10

2. Maximum distance from an annotated 3' end to be called annotated
Default: 10

Note that if there are overlapping transcripts, more than one may be called as the same "annotated" transcript, depending on how the distance parameters are set.


OUTPUT
------
1. BED file of validated isoform structures: this file is in bed format, using all 12 standard fields. The coordinate for the 5' start is taken from the Iso-Seq consensus 5' start site and the coordinate for the 3' end is taken from the Illumina poly(A) read consensus 3' end. The name is that of one of the Iso-Seq isoforms representing that transcript, prefixed by any matching annotated transcript. The score is the number of SMRT reads that support that transcript. ThickStart and thickEnd (fields 7 and 8) match chrStart and chrEnd (fields 2 and 3): no information about ORFs is inferred. If the transcript is called as annotated, the color (field 9) is imported from the annotation file.

2. A text file with the number of total, novel and annotated isoforms validated, and a record of the input files.
